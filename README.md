# Digital Communications Projects in Python

This repository contains a set of Python-based simulation projects for **Digital Communications**. These projects cover various modulation and demodulation techniques, providing a hands-on approach to understanding key concepts in digital communication systems.

## Projects Included

1. **PAM (Pulse Amplitude Modulation) Transmission**  
   Simulation of baseband PAM transmission using **cosine Raised pulses**.

2. **QAM16 (16-QAM) Transmission and Reception**  
   Simulation of **16-QAM** modulation and demodulation for signal transmission and reception.

3. **BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) Transmission and Reception**  
   Simulation of **BPSK** transmission with the use of **linear block codes** for error correction.

4. **OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)**  
   A complete simulation of an **OFDM system**, showing how data is transmitted over multiple subcarriers.
